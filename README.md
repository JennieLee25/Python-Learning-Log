# Python-Learning-Log
Welcome to my Python Learning Log!  

I am currently learning Python as a beginner, and this repository is where I record my learning journey. 

I will document:
- Concepts and syntax I learn (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Practice exercises and small projects
- Reflections on challenges and what Iâ€™ve learned

My goal is to gradually improve my Python skills and build mini projects that demonstrate my understanding. This log will serve as both a personal record and a portfolio of my growth in programming.
